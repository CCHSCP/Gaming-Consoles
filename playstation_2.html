 <div class="The summary">
 <h2>A amazing start</h2>
 <p>It all started in 1999 when Sony announced the Playstation 2 on March 1st. It was announced at a pre-e3 conference<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-announces-ps2-launch-date-and-price/1100-2568701/" target=_blank>(source here)</a>. The company hoped the console's sales would drive a wedge in Sega Dreamcast's market. This inevitably was bound to happen. But it also  became competetors with Nintendo's Gamecube and Microsoft's Xbox. Two major heavy hitters in the market. The Console sold incredibly well, there was always a shortage in the opening months of it's sales. The console in fact sold so well it outsold the Sega Genesis. The Genesis was later discontinued only 18 months into it's lifespan. Sony was in the game and wouldn't be taken out until much later. In fact Ps2 wouldn't be discontinued until 2013. By then at least 2 console generations had sold, but people still bought  and sold them because they loved the games and the console. The games felt like real genuine games, they were intuitive and pioneering since most of those games led the way for game development today.</p>
